# Medicare disparity data explorer

An experiment to see of scatter plot, histograms and box-plots are a helpful way of exploring the Center for Medicare and Medicaid [disparity data](https://data.cms.gov/tools/mapping-medicare-disparities-by-population)

It was inspired by the observation that the tool provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid is not an effective way to explore such a rich dataset. 

This visualization contains only a small slice of the entire data set. In order to add more parameters, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid would need to provide a publicly facing API for the data
